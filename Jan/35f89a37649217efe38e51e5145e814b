You might pretend that it means nothing. You might act like it doesn t bother you. And you might even come up with a thousand excuses just to justify the things he does.But no matter how you choose to deal with it, the truth remains- there are some things that no boyfriend, husband, significant other, or human being should ever be allowed to do to another human being.If you feel like your partner does any of these 9 things, then maybe it s time to start re-evaluating your relationship. You would look so much better if you just cut your hair a little shorter. Is it me or has your skin color gotten a little dark lately? You should really take a class on how to dress up or wear makeup when you go out A good man will never make comments about your appearance in a demeaning manner or make you feel bad about the way you look.Sometimes, when your partner keeps doing this, he is consciously trying to lower your self-worth in order to ensure that you don t have the confidence left to leave him.It is his way of controlling you and it is a form of emotional abuse. Do not allow it!&nbsp;
