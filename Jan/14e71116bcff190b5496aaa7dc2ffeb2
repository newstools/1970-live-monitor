 She doesn t seem like she cares anymore. The sad truth about relationships is that they are rarely ever perfect. A lot of relationships won t ever have the privilege of seeing itself go all the way because human beings are inherently imperfect, and their imperfections play into the dynamics of the relationship as a whole.There are lots of cases wherein people fall in and out of love with each other throughout the course of a relationship.What people have to understand is that so many conditions and variables have to be perfect in order for a relationship to have a fighting chance. Love alone isn t enough to sustain a relationship. It takes a lot of commitment, hard work, time, effort, and heaps of good luck.However, there s no getting around the fact that people fall out of love with each other. It always hurts whenever that happens.You wouldn t want to wish that kind of emotional pain or trauma unto your worst enemy. It s a common occurrence, and the best that you can do whenever it happens to you is to just try your best to move on with your life.The earlier you can spot the problems in your relationship, the easier it will be for you to move on from the situation.If you can spot early signs of your girlfriend falling out of love with you, then that will bode better for you in the long run.You feel like there s no effort there and that her affection for you is slowly dying.It s as if she s lost interest in life in general, but in truth, she has only lost interest in you.It s as if all the vitality and animation that was once in her life has suddenly vanished, and you don t know what to do about it.&nbsp;
