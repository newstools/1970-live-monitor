Whether it&#8217;s writing a song, painting a picture, or to use a real-life example cross-stitching a T-Rex for your dinosaur-mad girlfriend combined with her favorite quote from Jurassic Park ( clever girl! ), creating something for your girlfriend demonstrates thought, effort and sometimes a sense of humor.Remember, it&#8217;s for your partner, not for a gallery or concert hall, so don&#8217;t beat yourself up too much about your creative abilities.
