Hey ladies, yep, I m talking to you again! You lovely, lovely women that you are. I take it by now you ve noticed that us men aren t the most observant in the world. In fact you could probably have life-altering all over plastic surgery and he wouldn t bat an eyelid. He d say Hi Susan when your name is actually Jane . We re probably not as bad as that but you get the image. Men, when it comes to observation = sadly lacking.So you want to tell the guy that you re interested in, that you re interested. It s a fair deal, we men aren t the best at picking up on who s interested in us and who isn t, and it ll probably give you an incline if he s going to be interested in you too. Let s get to it. On with the show. Before you recoil in utter disgust that I am suggesting that you ask a man out on a date because we all know that what that subliminally tells him. I mean the more subtle form of Hey, I m going to the boat racing tomorrow, it ll be a nice day, you should come and then that should spark his curiousity, plus you can get to know him better without the pressures of you both being on a date, or an official date and whatever happens on the day you should roll with it. Just be open and friendly, and for god sakes let him make the first move! Of course this will only work if you know him better than just saying hey as you pass in the corridor, so remember that. No asking people you barely speak to you.&nbsp;
