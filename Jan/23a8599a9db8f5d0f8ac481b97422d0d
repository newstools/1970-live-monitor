Our top five include a bus, a van, a hotel swimming pool and a field. We wanted to see if we could top it, he said.The pair from Bridlington had been drinking in Leeds during the day to celebrate Smith s birthday before travelling to Scarborough.The footage surfaced on Twitter after it was captured on Saturday night in the Castle Road eatery after Leeds United s 1-0 win over Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday.Asked about the incident, a spokesperson for the Domino s shop said: We can t comment on something like that it s a no comment from us.
