One of the more obvious ways to know your friend is crushing on you is if they suddenly become meticulous with their appearance. This is especially the case when they know you are going to be somewhere, and make the extra effort to look their best.If you notice that, all of a sudden, your friend begins peering at you, it may be a sign you ve become more attractive to them. A usually reliable sign is if they seem to do this at the expense of pretty much everyone else in the room. They may even lower their eyes or look elsewhere if you look back.&nbsp;
