Lagos &#8211; Nigerian pastor and founder of the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN), TB Joshua, has explained a strange creature that hovered above Zambia last week. He also released a prophecy that is related to the incident, and advised Christians to pray to cancel &#8216;evil&#8217; plans the &#8216;devil&#8217; has for Africa.Joshua made a rather &#8220;alarming&#8221; prophecy about the strange creature that was seen in Zambia during the Sunday service at his Synagogue Church Of All Nations in Nigeria.&#8220;We are living in the end times. I see satan trying to destroy the world using water. But you know God promised that he will never again destroy the world with water, in the times of Noah and the Ark. Cyclone Dineo is the work of the devil. It is a water spirit. You heard about a cloud that had a shape of a person in Zambia? It is a water spirit. We are under attack by the devil.&#8221;&#8220;I see more damage being caused by water this year, in areas like Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Very bad things are going to happen. Churches will be destroyed. We need to keep praying. Encourage each other to pray. God can reverse these bad things,&#8221; Joshua said.Joshua is on record to have predicted major world events, including the death of iconic Michael Jackson, ISIS-inspired terror incidents in Paris and the mysterious diasppearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370.
