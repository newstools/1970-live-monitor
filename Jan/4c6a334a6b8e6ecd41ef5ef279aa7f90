Yeah, yeah, you all heard that women love funny men. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll win her heart by firing off jokes when she&#8217;s in the middle of a work crisis! Contrary to popular opinion, it probably won&#8217;t make her feel better. She&#8217;s trying to talk about something that&#8217;s important to her and you&#8217;re seizing the opportunity to make a joke that SNL did five years ago. I hate to break it to you, but it wasn&#8217;t funny then and it certainly won&#8217;t strike her as funny when she&#8217;s upset because she deleted the wrong file on her computer.&nbsp;
