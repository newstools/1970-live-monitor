You could have a great guy but you&#8217;re driving him away. You try and try, yet you can t keep a guy. Sorry about the rhyme but I couldn t resist.It s so frustrating, isn t it? This is a situation many ponder but don t know how to fix.Let s see what we can do to push you forward, get you thinking about what needs to be done, and work on rectifying this nightmare once and for all. Here are the 7 possible reasons why men don&#8217;t like you&#8230; and how you can fix it:1. You don&#8217;t find yourself delightful. &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;&#8220;No, you don t.&#8221;We can debate this all day but if you did, the men would be there. One thing I ve learned from watching successful couples over the year and reflecting upon my own former disastrous experiences is that if you don t TRULY enjoy who you are, the right guy does not show up.I always wondered why some women, who I may not consider very attractive, get great guys. The answer is simple they feel good about themselves. Whether they were born with high self-esteem, people told them they were good, or they figured it out themselves, they accomplished a huge feat.They like who they are. And they reap the benefits of that self-love because all kinds of good things happen in their lives. Self-esteem is everything and if you don t have it, you need to get it.You ll have to go within yourself to capture this pot of gold. How you do that is up to you. Perhaps counseling, helpful reading materials, self-exploration or all three are in order.Either way, once you take the time to deal with it, you can begin to thrive in the relationship department.&nbsp;
