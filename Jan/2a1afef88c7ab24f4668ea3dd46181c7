A fake report, which began circulating late on Wednesday evening, claimed that the athlete had died while in the US.Caster was evidently not impressed by the report.Speaking to MzansiLIVE on Thursday morning Caster could not contain her anger.&#8220;So if I am dead then this must be my ghost speaking to you. Maybe I am a ghost then,&#8221; a fuming Caster said.The fake report claimed that Caster apparently died after suffering chest pains and the news was &#8216;confirmed&#8217; by her wife Violet Raseboya.But if you had any doubt, there you have it fam. Or maybe next time you see Caster sprinting down a track, its her ghost!&nbsp;
