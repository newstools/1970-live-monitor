The fixture was abandoned on Tuesday night after 41 minutes when the floodlights went out because of a power failure.With the power failure affecting Loftus and the surrounding areas, and expected to take quite a while to fix, it was agreed to continue and finish the game on Wednesday morning.It kicked off in the 42nd minute at 10am on Wednesday morning in a rather subdued manner. But the second half sprang into action, with both teams upping the intensity in search of goals.For Sundowns, Percy Tau and Yannick Zakri went close, while, at the other end, the Port Elizabeth side continued to press hard to try to find a way past the opposition defence.Sundowns, though, gradually got the upper hand and further opportunities accrued to Sibusiso Vilakazi, Tau and Leonardo Castro.Chippa, too, had their moments, with central defender Wayne Arendse and midfielder Hlompho Kekana having to make timely tackles to deny the visitors.In the end, a draw and a point each was a fair reflection of the action.
