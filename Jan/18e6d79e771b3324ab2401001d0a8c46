First, let s just clear out one misconception. Girls like being physical just as much as guys do. It might mean something different to them but the pleasure associated with it is just the same.But no matter how much they like a guy, no matter how badly they want it and no matter how long it s been, there are some situations where girls just won t agree to sleep with you.Here are 4 of them:You might be the hottest guy in town. All the girls are crazy over your looks and this girl you took out to dinner feels no different. But that doesn t mean she ll want to take this date straight up to her room.She won t sleep with you on the first date and maybe not even on the second or the third. The only time she ll agree to it is when she s finally comfortable around you, when she finally feels like she s safe in your presence.It won t matter if you re the sexiest person she s ever seen, because that s about it. Your looks are all that she has seen.She doesn t know you, she doesn t know what kind of a person you are and for all she knows, you could turn out to be a psycho rapist.So don t even suggest it at the very beginning. This isn t just a physical experience for her; it s an emotional experience, as well.So, take her to some PG-13 dates at first, show her new and interesting places, get to know her better, and when you re sure she s ready, then make your move.
