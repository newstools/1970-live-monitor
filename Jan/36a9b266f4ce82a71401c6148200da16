According to tabloid Sunday World, maskandi artist Mroza is yet to be paid the prize money of R150 000 and a R129 000 Kia Picanto he won in the SABC s song of the year contest.The owner of the record label concerned, Reggie Nkabinde, also the ANC Youth League s treasurer, also allegedly hasn t paid him the money for three appearance fees.Mroza, real name Sithembiso Fakude, told Sunday World the disagreements led to him leaving Mabala Noise. He reportedly accused Nkabinde of having treated him like a monkey, a baboon, a pig, a wild animal and lumpen simply because I m illiterate .Nkabinde did not answer any attempts for comment from the tabloid.Mroza has accused Nkabinde of trying to nationalise what s rightfully his. He says he would have sued, but he doesn t have money for a lawyer.The SABC s Owen Ndlovu confirmed to Sunday World that he had deposited Mroza s winnings in Mabala Noise s account and had also handed over the car to the label. He explained that part of the reason for this was because Mroza does not have a driver s licence.The Subulala Van Damme song literally means We are going to kill Van Damme but it is apparently an ode to overcoming any obstacle, according to Mroza.Let s see if it helps him to overcome this one.
