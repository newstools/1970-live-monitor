Orlando Pirates midfielder Dove Wome knows what is expected from them as players when the Sea Robbers face Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto derby on Saturday.Wome is set to make coach Kjell Jonevret s match day squad for a debut in the derby. The Togolese international is cementing his place in the Buccaneers squad following his loan move from SuperSport United, having scored twice in three games. A few players like [Tendai] Ndoro have been telling me about how this game is important for the club and the supporters, says Wome, who hopes the team effort carries them through. He has told me that though this game is big, I must relax and play my normal football. There is nothing that has changed about the football, it is just the crowd. I have been hearing a lot of good things, and hopefully, it is going to be nice.I am a player, and for myself I need to work hard and work for the team. We just need to work as a collective to win this game, no matter who scores. The goal can come from anywhere, but teamwork and team spirit is going to be key for us, he says. This is my first derby, and I am obviously very happy to be part of this game. I hope I get a chance to play. This game for me is emotional, it is good for us because maybe it is going to be our turning point, you never know. I have always watched this derby on television, so playing in front of that crowd will be emotional.For me to have been out for a lot of months without playing and then coming back to have some game time, I have to prove myself. I have to do what I am capable of.I have to show what I am capable of, and that is what I am doing, though credit must always go to the team because the supplier is the one who passes the ball, concludes Wome.
