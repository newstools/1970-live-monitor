Within a month or two of HIV entering the body, 40% to 90% of people experience flulike symptoms known as acute retroviral syndrome (ARS).But sometimes HIV symptoms don&#8217;t appear for years sometimes even a decade after infection.&#8220;In the early stages of HIV infection, the most common symptoms are none,&#8221; says Michael Horberg, MD, director of HIV/AIDS for Kaiser Permanente, in Oakland, Calif. One in five people in the United States with HIV doesn&#8217;t know they have it, which is why it&#8217;s so important to get tested, especially if you have unprotected sex with more than one partner or use intravenous drugs.Here are some signs that you may be HIV-positive.One of the first signs of ARS can be a mild fever, up to about 102 degrees F.The fever, if it occurs at all, is often accompanied by other usually mild symptoms, such as fatigue, swollen lymph glands, and a sore throat.&#8220;At this point the virus is moving into the blood stream and starting to replicate in large numbers,&#8221; says Carlos Malvestutto, MD, instructor of infectious diseases and immunology in the department of medicine at NYU School of Medicine in New York City. &#8220;As that happens, there is an inflammatory reaction by the immune system.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;
