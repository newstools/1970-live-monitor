1. Break the nice guy or best friend stereotype.Often times, the guys that find themselves in the friend zone are there because they ve adopted the nice guy, or best friend role. Once this happens it can be tough to share your true feelings with your love interest, especially if you re worried that it will make her feel pressured or ruin the friendship.While it s okay to consider possible outcomes, the problem with biting your tongue is that you re putting her feelings above your own. To get out of the friend zone you must first find the confidence to let your crush know, verbally or through actions, that you re interested in being more than just friends.&nbsp;
