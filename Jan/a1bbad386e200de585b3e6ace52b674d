Your relationship, whether it be romantic or not, should make you feel excited and happy about life, not stifled, repressed, or unloved. Many people stay in unhappy relationships just because they fear being alone or can t picture their life without the person, even if their current situation doesn t truly fulfill them anymore.Everyone deserves respect, compassion, and love in relationships, but if you don t feel as though your partner gives those to you, you might want to rethink your relationship with him or her.First and foremost, a healthy relationship begins with respect for both individuals.You should never tolerate someone who calls you names, puts you down, or makes you feel uncomfortable in any way.Even if you re having a heated argument, it doesn t give your partner the right to treat you with disrespect just because they can t control their language.&nbsp;
