Finding the perfect guy is not an easy task and the fact that there s such a small pool of candidates for us to choose from makes it even more frustrating.Still, most girls manage to find the ability and patience to keep looking and looking until they finally get that one guy who they always desired, the one who makes their world spin just by looking at them from across the room, the one who brings never ending love and excitement in their life and the one who they can actually imagine spending their entire lives with.But then there are those girls who let their minds take their decisions for them and not their hearts, who just can t seem to settle on any guy they meet and who let their intelligence get the better of their emotions.So if you know a girl like this, you ve probably seen these following traits in her:She doesn t want a guy to come and fill an empty space in her life or to come and hold her tight in the lonely hours of the night.No, she s perfectly capable of handling her own life and her own problems.So the only time that she ll actually want to be in a relationship is when she ll know that what she s getting is truly what she deserves.She won t just settle for any guy who come her way but will keep looking to find that one person who is as independent, secure and mature as her.
