In accordance to a scientific research carried out in Norway, people who drink three cups of milk a day have three times bigger probability of developing breast cancer than people who only drink one cup or even half a cup of milk a day.Previously, it was believed that milk was accelerating the advance of cancer which has already developed. Nevertheless, researchers now claim that milk might be the one to blame for the expansion of the growth of cancer in a wider scale.The greatest part of breast cancer patients come from Finland, Sweden, Great Britain, Canada and the United States. Each of these nations is a leader in the consumption of milk.A Norwegian study discovered that breast cancer does not exist in societies where the consumption of milk is at a low level.The researchers claim that the hormones and components of development in the milk have a great carcinogenic potential, and this is applied equally to the supplements of vitamin D, who improve milk and other milk products periodically.The results have shown that people who suffered from the negative effects of breast cancer consume the double amount of vitamin D compared to others.But, there are also other factors to bear in mind. The reduction of the consumption of vegetables and fish, and the increase of the consumption of pasta, sugar, processed foods, as well as pork have all contributed to the increased number of cases of breast cancer.On the other hand, bras can also be a major cause for breast cancer. The women who often wear a support for more than 12 hours, have a higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to the women who only wear it occasionally or never use it, especially the types of bra with metal support
